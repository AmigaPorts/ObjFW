Legend:
 * Changes of existing features or bugfixes.
 + New features.

ObjFW 0.2.1 -> 0.3, 09.05.2010
 + Many new methods were added to different classes.
 + A huge amount of methods was added to OFStream, allowing easy binary
   stream handling and even mixing string-based and binary operations.
 + An optional write buffer was added to OFStream.
 + OFSeekableStream was added for streams that allow seeking, for example
   OFFiles.
 * OFNumber was completely reworked and got many new features now.
 * Large parts of OFDictionary were rewritten for better readability, better
   memory usage and to fix a bug with removing objects.
 * OFThread has been greatly improved.
 * Many small optimizations.
 * Many documentation improvements.
 * Method replacing was reworked and the methods renamed.
 + Tests for OFStream were added.
 * A bug with building ObjFW as a Universal Binary Framework was fixed.
 + Support for ObjFW-RT, the ObjFW Objective C runtime, was added.
 * Sockets are now properly closed before an exception is thrown.
 * Error handling with sockets was improved.
 * OFFile now uses open(), read() and write(), thus allowing -[readLine] to be
   used on of_stdin and fixing many other annoyances.
 * A few misc methods were renamed.
 + OFApplication was added.
 * All tests and the table generator are now using OFApplication.
 + It is now possible to get the remote address of an OFTCPSocket.
 + OFString can now build paths in the OS-native format.
 + It is now possible to create a string with the contents of a file.
 + Many new file operations were added to OFFile.
 * The existing file operations in OFFile were improved.
 * Almost all functions that returned self before now return void.
 + OFHash was added as a superclass for OFMD5Hash and OFSHA1Hash and OFHashes
   renamed to OFHash.
 + objfw-compile was added for easy compilation of ObjFW projects, which
   includes dependency checking for headers etc.
 * The instance variable naming convention was changed so that properties work.
 + Properties were added to the interfaces and are used if they are supported
   by the compiler.
 + The library version is now included in the resulting dylib and libobjc is
   reexported now. Additionally, objfw-config offers --reexport now to produce
   libraries that link against ObjFW and reexport it.

ObjFW 0.2 -> 0.2.1, 14.03.2010
 * Fix for OFNumbers not doing calculations.
 * Improved -[hash] for OFNumbers with floats and doubles.
 + Tests for OFNumber.
 * Small optimization for OFArray's -[componentsJoinedByString:].
 * Documentation improvements.
 * Updated copyright.

ObjFW 0.1.2 -> 0.2, 01.02.2010
 + Support for ObjC 2 Fast Enumerations on every platform which has
   compiler support for fast enumerations.
 + Support for ObjC 2 properties on every platform with compiler support.
 + Fast Enumeration through arrays and dictionaries.
 * OFIterator has been removed.
 + OFEnumerator was added to replace OFIterator, which is more general
   and works with arrays and dictionaries.
 + Portable implementation for atomic operations.
 + Portable implementation for spinlocks. They use atomic operations if
   available, if not they fall back to pthread spinlocks. If both are
   unavailable, mutexes are used as a last fallback.
 * -[retain] and -[release] are now atomic. If no atomic operations are
   available, spinlocks are used (which can fall back to mutexes, see
   above).
 * -[readLine] now handles \r\n without having the \r included in the
   returned line.
 + OFThread now has -[tryLock].
 * Mutation methods have been removed from immutable interfaces, thus
   already giving an error at compilation instead of at runtime.
 * Dependencies between headers have been reduced, leading to faster
   compile times.
 * The interfaces of OFSocket and OFStream were cleaned up and some
   methods were moved to OFTCPSocket, as they make sense only there.
 * File methods unavailable on Windows don't throw an exception at
   runtime anymore, but instead are not even in the interface on
   Windows. This way, it is a compile time error instead of a runtime
   error.

ObjFW 0.1.1 -> 0.1.2, 15.01.2010
 * Fix a bug in OFMutableArray's -[removeObject:] and
   -[removeObjectIdenticalTo:] that could lead to not removing all
   occurrences of the object from the array and to out of bounds reads.
 * Change the URL in the framework plist to the homepage.

ObjFW 0.1 -> 0.1.1, 04.01.2010
 * Fix a missing out of range check for -[removeNItems:atIndex:] that
   allowed the programmer to specify too big ranges so it would crash
   instead of throwing an exception.
 * Fix missing calls to -[retain] and -[autorelease] when getting
   objects from an OFArray or OFDictionary.
 * Safer and more fault-tolerant way to remove objects from an
   OFMutableArray.
 * Calling +[dealloc] throws an exception now. If someone really calls
   [SomeClass dealloc], this should be punished and not ignored, as
   this is a serious programmer error.
 * -[readLineWithEncoding:] is more fault-tolerant now and does not
   lose data when it stumbles upon invalid encoding. Instead, it allows
   recalling with the correct encoding now.

ObjFW 0.1, 24.12.2009
 + Initial release

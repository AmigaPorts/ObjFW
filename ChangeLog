ObjFW 0.1.1 -> 0.1.2, 15.01.2010
 * Fix a bug in OFMutableArray's -[removeObject:] and
   -[removeObjectIdenticalTo:] that could lead to not removing all
   occurrences of the object from the array and to out of bounds reads.
 * Change the URL in the framework plist to the homepage.

ObjFW 0.1 -> 0.1.1, 04.01.2010
 * Fix a missing out of range check for -[removeNItems:atIndex:] that
   allowed the programmer to specify too big ranges so it would crash
   instead of throwing an exception.
 * Fix missing calls to -[retain] and -[autorelease] when getting
   objects from an OFArray or OFDictionary.
 * Safer and more fault-tolerant way to remove objects from an
   OFMutableArray.
 * Calling +[dealloc] throws an exception now. If someone really calls
   [SomeClass dealloc], this should be punished and not ignored, as
   this is a serious programmer error.
 * -[readLineWithEncoding:] is more fault-tolerant now and does not
   lose data when it stumbles upon invalid encoding. Instead, it allows
   recalling with the correct encoding now.

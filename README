ObjFW is a portable, lightweight framework for the Objective C language.
It enables you to write an application in Objective C that will run on
any platform supported by ObjFW without having to worry about
differences between operating systems or various frameworks that you
would otherwise need if you want to be portable.

See https://webkeks.org/objfw for more information.


INSTALLATION

  To install ObjFW, just run the following commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

  In case you checked out ObjFW from the Mercurial repository, you need
  to run the following command first:

    $ ./autogen.sh


BUILDING AS A MAC OS X FRAMEWORK

  It is also possible to build ObjFW as a Mac OS X framework. To do so,
  just execute xcodebuild -target ObjFW in the root directory of ObjFW or open
  the .xcodeproj in Xcode and choose Build -> Build from the menu. Copy the
  resulting ObjFW.framework to /Library/Frameworks and you are done.


USING THE MAC OS X FRAMEWORK IN XCODE

  To use the Mac OS X framework in Xcode, you need to add the .framework
  to your project and add the following flags to "Other C Flags":

    -fconstant-string-class=OFConstantString -fno-constant-cfstrings

  Additionally, since Xcode 4, you need to manually set the compiler to GCC
  or LLVM-GCC due to bugs in Clang on OS X with using a different constant
  string class.

  Optionally, if you want to use blocks, you also need to add:

    -fblocks
